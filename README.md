I know I am late to the party but this is a start.

Hey folks, this is Abhishek. I am in love with Swift, Apple's framework (Xcode) and Music. 
Creating stuff, brainstorming ideas, tweaking and testing them and also helping fellow learners/oppurtunists achieve their goals is where I do not facade.

Enjoy the style of life you want, by simply working to create it.

Abhishek out.
